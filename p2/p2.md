# K3s and three simple applications
- One virtual machine set up with Vagrant
- K3s in server mode installed.
- 3 web applications running in the K3s instance
- Accessing the apps depending on the host when making a request to the IP address 192.168.56.110

## Access from a web browser the different services of our cluster
Specify which entry points (ports) Traefik should use to expose the Ingress resource:
```
annotations:
    traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/router.entrypoints: web
```

- An entry point in Traefik is a network port where Traefik listens for incoming traffic.

- The value `web` refers to a named entry point that should be defined in your Traefik configuration. By convention, `web` typically refers to HTTP traffic on port 80.

## In the main VM or Host machine change the file /etc/hosts:
```
<EXTERNAL-IP> <HOST>
<EXTERNAL-IP> app2.com
<EXTERNAL-IP> app3.com
```

# useful commands
Check external IP:
```
sudo kubectl get svc -n kube-system
```

check if traefik pod is running:
```
sudo kubectl -n kube-system get pods | grep traefik
```
